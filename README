Backend Status

This is a small project for showing the status of your Apache backends, as
reported by a group of Perlbals on the frontend.  This is not finished and
doesn't have a reporting/frontend on it yet.

The idea, though, is to use a small Perlbal plugin that sends UDP packets
to the backend-status-server (written in Go).  This server collates the
information and presents it in a JSON format that you can consume with
whatever consumer you want.

This is mostly a demo for now.  Installing it is left as an exercise to the
reader.  You basically just have to copy the plugin to your Perlbal::Plugin
directory, add it to your config file, and write a frontend.

A demo/short frontend is included in the test-frontend.pl script.
